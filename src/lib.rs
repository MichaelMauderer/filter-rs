# filter-rs

**filter-rs** is a port of the [filterpy](https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy) library.
This library is a work in progress. To learn more about Kalman filters check out Roger R Labbe Jr.'s
awesome book [Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)
